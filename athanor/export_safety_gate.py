"""ATH-2960 fork export-safety gate for the public Athanor RTL forks.

This is a fail-closed CI gate for the public ``openc910-athanor`` /
``riscv-boom-athanor`` forks. It scans the **committed bytes** of every tracked
file at a ref (default ``HEAD``) via ``git ls-tree`` + ``git show <ref>:<path>``,
never the working tree, so locally generated artifacts -- in particular
``*.replay.log`` files, which embed the caller's pinned tool paths -- can neither
false-trip the gate nor let a real committed leak hide behind "it is only a
local file".

It scans BYTES, not ``git grep``, on purpose: the packages mark ``*.log`` /
``*.sv`` / ``*.v`` as ``binary`` in ``.gitattributes``, and ``git grep -I``
silently SKIPS binary files -- so a token or key inside a ``*.pinned.log`` (the
verbatim tool output where a real credential is likeliest to leak) would slip
past a git-grep scan. Reading committed bytes and matching directly closes that
gap regardless of ``.gitattributes``. (ATH-2960, blind spot caught in review on
PR #4.)

Two tiers (customer-surface owner ruling, ATH-2960):

  BLOCK  hard-safety leaks; any committed-tree hit fails the gate:
           - internal absolute filesystem paths and home directories
           - tmp / tool-cache paths
           - the cloud build username
           - the internal ops-repo name
           - confidential customer names
           - secret tokens (GitHub, Slack, AWS, AI-provider API keys, private keys)
           - AI-tool / vendor authorship markers (the bot attribution footer)

  WARN   conscious-choice internal metadata; surfaced, never blocks:
           - internal Linear ticket IDs
           - the private Kairos-repo pointer
         These are not secrets or paths -- their exposure is a deliberate
         per-artifact choice and some is intentional/team-settled, so the gate
         reports them for a conscious keep/scrub decision rather than blocking.

It also runs the package receipt verifier (SHA256 manifest + ``receipt.json``
parse) and is fail-closed if that verifier is missing or errors.

The forbidden strings below are assembled from fragments so this gate's OWN
source never contains a verbatim forbidden literal -- otherwise it would
self-trip on every run. (The receipt verifier uses the same convention.)

Exit codes:
  0  clean (WARN findings allowed)
  1  a BLOCK leak was found, or the receipt verifier failed
  2  the gate itself could not run (not in a git repo, git missing, ...)
