"""ATH-3397: generate the fork-local fleet-handle denylist from the roster SSOT.

PORTED from ibex-athanor athanor/gen_fleet_handle_denylist.py @ 19be650c (ATH-3426
pass-2 twin-sync stamp: keep the two forks' generators byte-aligned on edit).

The export-safety gate must block internal fleet-agent handles from appearing
in published customer artifacts on the public forks. asabi's ruling on this
class: do NOT hardcode the handle list -- it goes stale the moment the
fleet gains a member and then reads as coverage while missing the new name.
Consume the canonical roster SSOT instead: athanor-builder's
``tools/agent-handoff/roles.json`` (ATH-1343), so a new member's display name
appears in the gate automatically.

The forks cannot import athanor-builder, so this generator runs at FLEET level
(where roles.json is readable) and commits a derived denylist into the fork.
Integrity of the committed copy is enforced fork-locally by a stamp; freshness
against the live roster is enforced by re-running this generator on any roster
change (fleet-level), because a hash proves bytes are unchanged, never current.

DERIVATION -- the catch that keeps the gate usable: roles.json mixes person
HANDLES (the human display names) with generic ROLE-KEYS (research, builder,
platform, qa, cto, gpu, dogfood). Banning the role-keys would red on ordinary
English -- "builder" and "research" appear
all over upstream RTL -- so the gate would be disabled within a day. We select
person-handles only by excluding the generic role-key set. A new person handle
still auto-appears; a new generic role-key correctly does not get denied.

Usage:
  python3 athanor/gen_fleet_handle_denylist.py --roles <path/to/roles.json> \
      --out athanor/fleet_handle_denylist.json
