"""CI must install pytest at ONE exactly-pinned version (ATH-3443 class).

A test result is a property of (TREE x RESOLVED DEPENDENCIES). An unpinned
install makes a green unreproducible -- the one thing a green is supposed to
be -- and this fork's results are cited in receipts for published, hash-bound,
PUBLIC evidence. `main` on athanor-kairos went red with no code change when
`mcp 2.0.0` published against an uncapped `mcp>=1.0`; these five install sites
had no bound of any kind.

The pin is EXACT rather than a ceiling: "reproducible within a major" is not
reproducible, and evidence needs the stronger property.

The pin is DEFINED ONCE and referenced by every site. Five copies of a version
string is the maintained-list class -- pinning four and missing one leaves the
property broken while looking fixed. These tests exist so that miss is
UNCONSTRUCTIBLE rather than merely unlikely.
